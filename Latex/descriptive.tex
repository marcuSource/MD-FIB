\subsection{Final Data Description}
The iFood dataset includes 2,031 customers across nine variables, showing no missing data and excellent quality. Customers are predominantly middle-aged and well-educated, with a wide but reasonable income range (mean €52,844). Family structures are typically small, and complaints are extremely rare (0.98\%). Income relates positively to education and age but negatively to having children, while higher-income, recently active customers respond more to marketing campaigns. Overall, the data are well-behaved, balanced across variables, and suitable for multivariate modeling, with only one extreme income outlier and an imbalanced “Complain” variable as minor considerations.
